# Guide-Git-Github-Commands

This guide is the collection of my personal notes when taking the online course <The Git & Github Bootcamp> by Colt Steele. I organized the concepts and commands demonstrated during the lectures into a more structured way, with the goal of helping beginners to fast master the basic skills of Git and Github. Sincere thanks to Colt Steele, for this is a very excellent course.
